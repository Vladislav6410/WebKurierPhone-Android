# Gradle Wrapper Notes

This repository is being assembled from a mobile device (iPhone).
The `gradle-wrapper.jar` binary is intentionally not committed at this stage.

How to generate/update wrapper on a workstation (recommended):
```bash
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 8.7

CI (WebKurierHybrid) may also generate wrapper artifacts when needed.
